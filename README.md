# Choi Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I am excited to share my work in data analysis with you. This portfolio includes a selection of projects that illustrate my skills in data gathering, wrangling, exploration, statistical analysis, visualization, and presentation.

In the sections below, I will introduce myself and provide guidance on how to explore the projects within this portfolio. Let’s get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Analytics from Georgia Tech, where I developed a comprehensive understanding of data analysis, from data collection and cleaning to modeling and reporting. My academic experience has been instrumental in refining my analytical skills and equipping me to tackle complex data challenges effectively.

My passion for data began during my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Davis, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Statistics. I was captivated by the power of data and its ability to inform decision-making and drive impactful outcomes. This interest grew stronger as I engaged in various projects and coursework, where I honed my skills in statistics, programming, and data analysis.


This portfolio presents a variety of my work, showcasing projects that reflect my ability to turn data into actionable insights and contribute to strategic decisions.

## How to Navigate This Portfolio

To explore the projects in my portfolio, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Start with the Project Overviews**: Each project folder contains a README.md file that provides a detailed overview, including objectives, methodologies, tools, and key findings. These overviews will help you understand the scope and significance of each project.

2. **Examine the Code**: Inside each project folder, you’ll find Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts that document the analysis and modeling work. Reviewing these files will give you insight into my approach to data handling, analysis, and problem-solving.

3. **Run the Projects**: If you want to see the analysis in action, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the notebooks or scripts. Each project’s README.md file lists the necessary dependencies, so make sure to install these libraries to replicate the results.

4. **Review the Results**: Visualizations, results, and conclusions are included in each project to highlight the insights derived from the data and demonstrate their practical applications.

5. **Connect with Me**: I’m always open to discussions, questions, or feedback. If you’re interested in any of the projects or have questions, feel free to reach out using the contact information provided at the top of this README.md.
