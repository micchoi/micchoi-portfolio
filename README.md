# Choi Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I am excited to share my work in data analysis with you. This portfolio includes a selection of projects that illustrate my skills in data gathering, wrangling, exploration, statistical analysis, visualization, and presentation.

In the sections below, I will introduce myself and provide guidance on how to explore the projects within this portfolio. Letâ€™s get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Analytics from Georgia Tech, where I developed a comprehensive understanding of data analysis, from data collection and cleaning to modeling and reporting. My academic experience has been instrumental in refining my analytical skills and equipping me to tackle complex data challenges effectively.

My passion for data began during my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Davis, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Statistics. I was captivated by the power of data and its ability to inform decision-making and drive impactful outcomes. This interest grew stronger as I engaged in various projects and coursework, where I honed my skills in statistics, programming, and data analysis.


This portfolio presents a variety of my work, showcasing projects that reflect my ability to turn data into actionable insights and contribute to strategic decisions.

## How to Navigate This Portfolio

To explore the projects in my portfolio, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Start with the README.md files**: Each project has its own README.md file where you will find an overview of the project, the tools and techniques used, outcomes, and instructions for running each project. This will give you an understanding of the scope and impact of each project.

2. **Explore the code and notebooks**: Within each project folder, you will find Jupyter Notebooks, R scripts, or Python scripts that contain the code used for the analysis. Reviewing these files will provide insight into my coding practices and analytical processes.

3. **Run the code**: If you want to see the analyses in action, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts or R scripts.

4. **Review the results**: Each project includes visualizations, results, and conclusions.
